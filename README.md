Words of wisdom (Kalyani Banerjee)

Do not waste your time because time is so precious.


Do not try to take revenge with anybody. Time will do this eventually.

Nothing is impossible. Everything is possible if you wish it from the heart.

Kalyani Banerjee


When someone hurts you continuously, then do not cry near them
You only cry near Almighty God
Only God can hear you

The Truth can never hide forever

You can be an atheist, but do not be superstitious. You will lose your willpower. (adapted from a quote by Swami Vivekananda)

Each day try to have a conversation with yourself. (adapted from a quote by Swami Vivekananda)
